            <h2>'In the Mood for Love' Jasmine tea (by P&T)</h2>
            <p class="h-footer">by <a href="#p&t">Paper & Tea</a> - [<a href="https://www.paperandtea.com/products/in-the-mood-for-love-n-323">link</a>]</p>
            <p>
                <b>In The Mood for Love</b> is a tea i've been absolutely adoring. I saw it at one of my favourite tea shops <a href="#p&t" title="paper and tea" class="nav-link">(P&T)</a> while i was in Stuttgart with my dad and i knew it was destined for me (in case you don't know, i'm a huge wong kar-wai fan!). I smelled their sample, and i was mesmerized. In the Mood for Love smells like a flower field with a touch of honey. It smells like childhoods running around with friends, playing in the grass and getting your hands and trousers all green. Like a forgotten bench in the middle of a forest, grass grown all over it.<br>
            </p>

            <h4>notes ! (taste, preparation etc)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> i like brewing it for ~3 mins at ~70° (they recommend 2 mins, but i'm a serial over-brewer when it comes to tea) </li>
                <li>you can absolutely taste the grassy undertone, but i feel like it has this honey-like quality to it that is just amazing (it is, in my opinion, both a tea that calls for honey and one that doesn't need it at all)</li>
                <li>it's slightly bitter, but in a pleasant, light way</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>music!</h4>
            <p>
                In the Mood for Love is light, subtle music. It's green and white music. <br>
                It's the sort of music you'd listen to on the front porch of a country house by yourself in the morning, while dawn is breaking and the sky is starting to light up (<i>Rèverie L.68, Liz on Top of the World, Mystery of Love, Ce matin-là,, Avril 14th</i>). It's the kind of music you'd hear in a birch or holly-wooded house with a floral teapot and white tea cups and maybe (definitely) a tree in the living room (<i>Alone in Kyoto, Cherry Blossom Girl, I'll Be Your Mirror</i>). But it's also the music you sway your head to, eyes closed, when you're winding down, relishing the quiet loneliness of your own home after a day of writing and re-painting the walls (<i>The Bug Collector, Clay Pigeons, Velvet Ring, Première Gymnopédie</i>). <br>
                In the Mood for Love is hopeful music. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Earl Gray</h2>
            <p class="h-footer">by <a href="https://tedellaviatore.com/">Tè dell'Aviatore</a> - [<a href="https://tedellaviatore.com/prodotti/earl-grey-2/">link</a>]</p>
            <p>Earl gray is a timeless classic! And, to behttps://tedellaviatore.com/ honest, i got into it way too late. Until my little sister gifted it to me for my birthday last year, i thought it was overrated and a bit lame (i am often too skeptical of citrus-y flavours in general). I now think it's amazing (and so specific and zesty !), and i always make sure to have some at home.
            </p>

            <h4>notes ! (taste, preparation etc)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>thanks to the bergamot's freshness, earl gray can be drank in any season !!! and you can pair it up with almost anything !! my 'Tè dell'aviatore' Ceylon Earl Gray is the tea i found myself reaching for the most in this hot summer. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>also (as i found out <a href="nov-stuff.html#tea" alt="november post">in november</a>) it goes perfectly with oat milk!!</li> 
                    </ul>
                </li> 
                <li>i usually brew it at around 90°, for ~4 minutes</li>
                <li>actually, it's the tea i've repurchased the most! my mother (who likes dipping 'digestive' biscuits in it) and i have gone through at least three jars </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>music!</h4>
            <p> Earl gray is a moody funky morning. It's jazzy (like its bergamot twist!) and energetic, and it's green-gray-ish. It's the smell that fills the tree-lined streets when the rain is done, and the mist still hangs above the asphalt. It's the dew on a newly-born leaf. Earl gray is Silk Skin Lovers !!! and Ryo Fukui after waking up, as you look at the yellow-lit buildings outside your kitchen window.</p>

            <h3>Brave New Earl</h3>
            <p> I also have <a href="#p&t">Paper & Tea</a>'s '<b>Brave New Earl</b>' [<a href="https://www.biblioteq.it/te-neri/80-1269-186-irish-breakfast.html#/6-formato-50_gr">link</a>], an earl gray with added jasmine tea! It's a subtler, lighter version that i bought in Stuttgart this summer and i'm really enjoying. Sadly, it doesn't have as much of the zest that i love in the traditional version, so i have to bump this version down to an 'A'-tier. </p>


            <h2>Lapsang Souchong</h2>
            <p class="h-footer">by <a href="#biblioteq">BiblioTèq</a> - [<a href="https://www.biblioteq.it/te-neri/211-1293-lapsang-souchong-te-affumicato.html#/6-formato-50_gr">link</a>]</p>
            <p>Lapsang souchong is one of the strongest and most distinctive teas in my collection.
                It was recommended to me by my friend flavio (thx flavio) during an exam session, and it has since become a permanent resident in my kitchen. Though the lady who sold it to me recommended blending it with other teas (and kind of tried to scare me off?), i really enjoy it on its own, too, as its smokiness and intensity make it an ideal companion for my savory breakfasts. </p>

            <h4>notes ! (taste, preparation etc)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>as it could be imagined (since this is a smoke-dried tea), it's very smokey (funnily, also in color)! it's also very savory/salty!! absurdly, i find that honey doesn't really sweeten it, but rather brings out its savory side in a way that reminds me of salted caramel</li>
                <li>i absolutely love its smell - if cigarettes smelled (or tasted) like lapsang souchong, i'd 100% be a chain-smoking french philosopher</li>
                <li>i do like to mix it in with almost everyting: the classic earl gray, my <a href="#russianblend">russian blend</a> (to give it more character), and sometimes even chai</li>
                <li>when drank by itself, i blend it for sometimes even 4.5 minutes at 90+°</li>
                <li>contrary to the lady's belief, i actually don't think it's particularly strong - sure, it has a very assertive flavour, but it's not heavy or as full-bodied as some other teas. in its natural, unsweetened state, there's an elusive lightness (maybe the same one that smoke, ephemerous, bears in its passing ?)</li> 
            </ul>


            <h4>music!</h4>
            <p>To me, Lapsang Souchong <i>is</i> Since I've Been Loving You. There's nothing to say about it. It's Robert Plant's whining voice, it's "i've been working from seven to eleven every night / i said it kind of makes my life a drag, a drag, drag". It's the roller-coaster the guitar leads you on, how it seems to drop you from a ten-story building with just a "siiiiince i've been loving you / i'm about to looose / my worried mind". It's all the smoke. And there's so much smoke in "'cause i love you baby / how i love you darling / how i love you baby" that i think i might just suffocate in it. <br>
                Lapsang souchong is a guy in a black coat and a small mustache who really likes sardines and old rock music and might just manipulate you if you ask him kindly enough.</p>

            <h2>Matcha</h2> 
            <p class="h-footer">still looking for a specific brand i really like</p>
            <p>Matcha is amazing. 
            <p>interesting dichotomy between its cerimonial origin and its pop-ification (it girl)</p>


            <h4>music!</h4>
            <p>
                a matcha latte is romanticising every day. it's pop music, music you dance to, you strut to with a pink walkman and retro headphones. it's a laptop covered in stickers. it's disabling caps lock. it's the hidden balance between 'everything is romantic', 'party 4 u' and 'girl, so confusing' (the lorde feature). it's french pop songs sang with a girly voice.

            </p>

            <h2>A tier</h2>

            <h2>'Russian Blend'</h2>
            <p class="h-footer">by <a href="#biblioteq">BiblioTèq</a> - [<a href="https://www.biblioteq.it/te-neri/76-1265-182-russian-blen.html#/6-formato-50_gr">link</a>]</p>

            <p>Russian Blend is  a tea i tried without a specific aim. I was still pretty new to tea and i was in BiblioTèq, looking through their black tea collection, probably searching for an English Breakfast to bring home (they actually don't carry one - i've always thought this very peculiar), and i think "Russian Blend" caught my attention because I've always been fascinated by my parents' stories of Russia. They visited it for separate reasons (my mother organised an exhibition of Fellini's drawings at the Pushkin Museum, and my father went to Siberia to shoot a documentary about the yeti), but, through the difference, so much beauty emerged from their stories. So i bought it. And i think it was an amazing choice. Russian blend is a light tea, sweet and undemanding, amazing both with and without honey,  drowned in milk or by itself. It's a tea i drink in oat milk, with a good portion of honey or agave syrup when i need to feel like i'm being enveloped by a warm snow blanket, and it's a tea i drink "bitter" (though it never really is) when i just want to relax on the couch and read an article, or i need a lighter black tea that won't weigh me down. It's a tea i need in my collection, and it's one of my most re-bought ones. (It's actually the only tea i also keep at my father's house). </p>

            <h4>notes ! (taste, preparation etc)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>i like brewing it for ~4 mins at ~95°</li>
                <li>fun fact! (according to Bibliotèq) it's a sweet tea because it's a russian tradition that a very concentrated infusion be prepared by leaving the leaves in a small amount of boiling water for a long time, which will then be watered down with hot water from a samovar, to make a cup of tea.</li>
                <li>as i said, it's a very subtle tea</li>
                <li>with milk and honey, it sort of reminds me of ambrosia, actually</li>
                <li>when drank by itself, i think it has some floral undertones somewhere</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>music!</h4>
            <p>Russian Blend is off-white. It's playing in the snow and coming home to a hot cup and some butter biscuits your mom made for you. It's the sun in a cold day. It's the music that comforts you, but at the same time reminds you of something you once lost. It's the "we let love be a call in the night" in Salt, the innocence of Only (and the "coming from the cold/buried under heat/lay you on the floor/" !!!), the silence in Berlin, the chants in Beacon, the absolute white embued in all of RY X's songs from Dawn. The tiredness of a long day in The Wisp Sings, the comfort of being home of Lights Are On, and, finally, the healing and love of Fourth of July.</p>
            <p>(I actually didn't make this playlist specifically for this tea, but i somehow managed to capture its essence in it anyway)</p>

            <p>I bought this green tea version of chai because of my often black-tea-centric view. I needed to expand my horizons, and this looked like a perfect bridge between the two worlds. And it didn't disappoint! I's a perfectly pleasant tea to enjoy in the late afternoon or even in the evening, and i find myself reaching for it quite often.</p>

            <h4>notes ! (taste, preparation etc)</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>i like brewing it for 3-4 mins at ~80°</li>
                <li>rather than fresh grass, this tastes like sun-dried herbs, drank on a hot afternoon while the sun is burning your eyes in some orange (or dark green)-colored city with a lot of windows and clothes hung to dry between the buildings</li>
                <li>you can taste the anise!</li>
                <li>while it’s definitely a light (green) tea, it’s not at all subtle (thanks to the spices) ! the flavour definitely hits you, leaving an aftertaste that lingers on for a while</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>when i drink it, i feel like i can even taste some smokey tones somewhere (?)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>music!</h4>

            <p>I don't really listen to summer-y songs, so it was hard to find one that could represent that burnt feeling well - i feel like the closest i can get is "Hey Ya!" by OutKast. It reminds me of a very very hot summer, and in the "heeeey yaaa"s, i can definitely sense some of the green chai's spices.</p>
