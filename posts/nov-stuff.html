                <h1>november favourites !</h1>
            </header>

            <p>November is a pretty nice month. I like the way days get shorter, blending into each other to the point of disappearance, and how the leaves start to fall.<br>
                How life gets frenzied, how people fight against time to get everything done, as if their duties had heard of the coming of the month and decided to start piling up.<br>
                I like the late afternoons spent studying with a nice candle, a hot tea and some good music. The red noses and rubbed hands on cold days, the small awkward jumps from one foot to the other that have never actually warmed anyone up. The melancholy in the air.<br>
                I like how, despite the fact that we know it's coming, every year it catches us off guard. How, never ready for the change it brings, we get mad at it for showing us where we're standing.<br>
                I like it all quite a bit.</p>
            <p>And this november, these are the things i enjoyed the most.</p>

            <h3>wong kar-wai movies</h3>
            This month, i caught up on the Wong Kar-Wai movies i absolutely had to watch. After having watched In the Mood for Love and Happy Together this summer, i was missing Chungking Express and Fallen Angels. I finally watched them, and i absolutely loved them! As I said in my very eloquent <a href="https://letterboxd.com/aglaianorza/film/chungking-express/">review</a>, the way Wong Kar-Wai portrays being human is mesmerising. The unique sensibility he has in treating his characters is, for lack of a better word, <i>crazy</i>. Watching either of this movies, it's impossible not to be captivated by the neon, messy, packed-full and yet ever empty Hong Kong and its inhabitants.<br>
            The peculiar habits through which his characters show their emotions (223 buying a can of pineapples everyday, Faye cleaning 663's apartment, Ho Chi-mo breaking into a different business every night)
