                so...
                it's been a while since i've written something. i could say that i've been busy studying, but it would only be partially true. <br>
                i guess that, recently, i've been really busy living. life can be extremely time-consuming (who would have thought !) <br>
                time has been behaving extremely weirdly, these days. every time i think i can get a hold of it, it finds a way to escape me.
                now, the days have changed into spring and, for the second year in a row, i'm not sure i'm ready to change with them. 
                i can feel their pull towards new things, their WAY OF FLOWING LIKE A RIVER SOMETHING SOMETHING. and i can see their destructive force, too. 
                that of a flood.
                there's definitely a part of me that likes being flooded.
                i picture spring as a frenzy. for me, 
            <p>

            <h3>movies!</h3>
            <p>i don't study at night if i can help it, so i've been catching up with some movies i still haven't seen (there are <em>so many</em> i know i should have seen but i haven't) - which meaaans: movie time!!</p>
            <p>notable: la haine, apocalypse now, crash, perfect blue, wallace and gromit, ci eravamo tanto amati, the seventh seal, mirror, lynch</p>

            <h3>music!!</h3>
            <p>I made a lot of very cool playlists recently !!
            <p>it was <em>my</em> exam session and <em>i</em> got to choose the dissociation music!</p>
            <p>guardare un film al giorno invece di studiare calcolo delle probabilità. inventario di alcune cose perdute (the idea of winter rather than roman winter itself)</p>

            <h3>i am gromit</h3>

            <h3>cool books!!</h3>
            <p>la ricreazione è finita, permafrost, the wasteland, le notti bianche</p>
