                <p class="h-footer">here we are</p>
            </header>

            <p>okay. i skipped some months. but we're back now.</p>
            <p>it's a little bit funny that i'm getting back to blogging in the fall (almost 1year after my first blog entry??), but it's also innate in fall's nature (or my perception of it, at least). [writing is mooody i used to write when i was sad]</p>

            <p>This fall, i have once again fallen prey to knowledge, mainly thanks to two causes. </p>

            <h2>knowledge!! (vienna ?)</h2>
            <p class="h-footer">uni is starting again!! (and this year, i get to pick the courses!)

            <p>
                the theme for this [period] is definitely curiosity.

                uni has started again (along with my ache to know things), and i've made so many cool knowledge-related discoveries.
            </p>

            <p> the first and most important propeller for my curiosity has been my research for a university to do my master's at. my friends and i have been looking for places outside of italy, and i stumbled upon TU Wien. it was my second choice for the erasmus i'm technically supposed to be doing right now (except i refused it twice), but i had kind of forgotten about it. big mistake!! i discovered their "logics and computability" (now called "logics and ai" (lame)) course, and it sounds, bluntly, so fucking fire.
                <br>
                its curriculum has led me to consider so many aspects and fields of computer science i had never had the chance to and that i think i could absolutely love (nonstandard deduction systems?? knowledge representation??? neurosymbolic reasoning ? automated deduction??), and, absurdly, it has been the catalyst to a series of events that have defined the last month of my life.
                <br>
                amongst the many, after / thanks to my finding out about it, i: 
                <ul>
                    <li> had the chance to have an extremely useful conversation about academia (one of my favourite topics), research in italy, vienna, tu wien itself (!!!) and more </li>
                    <li> could appreciate a presentation for a paper that one of my professors organised with a friend of his out of the blue and which crazily mentioned concepts i was looking at just the day before <small>(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10807")>this paper</a>) (i need to read the actual thing sooner or later)</small></li>
                    <li>have found a lot of interesting material i'm excited to delve into (i have, at this point, read at least two introductions/first chapters of knowledge representation and formal methods books) </li>
                    <li>am getting closer to finding a supervisor for my thesis ? <small>(aaaaa)</small> (by which i mean that i got from having absolutely no idea to having absolutely no idea, but in a more channeled way)</li>
                </ul>

                there are so many smaller things, too - the impact that finding this course has had in my life is unreal, and i've decided to take it as a sign that it's what i'm supposed to do.
                </p>
            <p>
                it's a huge step for my personal responsibility, too - deciding that this is what i want to do, and actually doing it. being ready to find a job, to leave everything behind to go someplace else. to walk new streets and speak new tongues, to find new bookstores to hide in when caught in the rain, new rooms to cram lectures in before a big exam. to get lost swaying around brand new lampposts listening to the same old music. but it's a step i feel like i've been waiting for forever.
                <br>
                i still haven't fully processed the idea that i might be leaving (and i don't need to yet), and there are many aspects of myself that i'm probably not ready to let go of, but i've been feeling, like never before, like the life ahead of me is full of possibilities. and i can't wait to take advantage of them.
            </p>


            <p>
                parallel to my looking forward to new courses for my master's, there's the fact that i've started the third year of my bachelor's degree! and i get to pick the courses !
            </p>

            <h3>academics, and talking about knowledge</h3>
            i've been wanting to write something about my relationship with academia (and academics) for a while.
            i originally planned on having 
            i want to be as close to the source of knowledge as possible



            <h2>music !!</h2> 
            i discovered A LOT of interesting music since the last time i posted on here. i would really really like to be able to talk about all of it in depth, but i'm going to stick to the things that resonate with the recent me. hopefully i'll get more consistent with the blog and won't need to catch up on these many months of music again.

            <h3>moodiness, or two playlists i love</h3>

            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5inhJR5dde2baFmGBbbyAt?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

            <p>
                his summer (on the same day, actually, july 24th), i made two of my favourite playlists ever: "you are raining in" and "ripples on a blank shore". though they have different vibes, in my head (probably because of the birthday they share) they exist in relation to each other. in some way, they represent a sort of duality of moodiness.<br> 
                "you are raining in" is getting on a bus late at night, looking through the window at the road that leads you back to the hometown you left behind you years ago and never hoped to see again. it's realising you're imperfect and always will be, the tension between the comfort of falling back into old patterns and the frustration of the empty hope of being capable of saving yourself. it's dark-toned music, guitars and drawn-out voices.<br>
                on the other hand, "ripples on a blank shore" is the call of the eerily unknown. it's standing in a field just outside of rotterdam, mist gathering on your glasses, nothing but green and grey in sight. it's abandoning yourself to the noises and the flow of life running circles around you, getting high off being aware of just how unaware you are. it's men whining in high-pitched voices, repeating words like mantras to a madman while the everything crumbles down. it's the yellow-white light scattered by shards of an old window.
            </p>
            <p>
                they're both playlists i keep coming back to, and it's as if i had made them just yesterday.
                also, they're very inspired by my discovery of panchiko! this year i got more into shoegaze-ish bands, and i am extremely grateful to spotify for recommending them to me. i love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchiko">way they became known</a> (and think it's extremely fitting for their music), and "Florida", "Ginkgo", and "Until i know" are now amongst some of my favourite songs.
            </p>

            <h3>the feels</h3>

            some other feelings i felt:

                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3FvywFllCF4G1r2T0WY6qq?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <ul>
                <li>excited about the world, getting home feet hurting drunk off laughs and yet surprisingly lucid in a city with lights that bleed and stars that shine twice as bright, remembering that you are alive and yourself is a great place to get lost in </li>
            </ul>

            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0ElnMthMgOzOCVSmthSgOp?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

            <ul>
                <li>resigned, mourning the loss of something that's still in your hands, smiling wistfully at the warmth of an old memory you know will fade soon - 'i was only falling in love'</li>
            </ul>

            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1tDObOr1r9uMTyNT1N6enj?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <ul>
                <li>(this month in songs) an october that feels like november, angry french spoken word and running behind on your coursework even though it has barely started, but still stopping to get a donut and a look at the sky (<i>fiore mio fiore della mia anima</i>) (<i>i'm moving to america, you won't see me for a while / if I get the ferry over, will the fairies follow me?</i>)</li>
            </ul>

            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3llePdK091GUAlprfQWxzI?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <ul>
                <li>moving on to a new phase in your life, realising you actually might be leaving ??</li>
            </ul>
