            <p>okay. i skipped some months. but we're back now.</p>
            <p>it's a little bit funny that i'm getting back to blogging in the fall (almost 1year after my first blog entry???), but it's also innate in fall's nature (or my perception of it, at least). fall is inspiration. fall is writing.</p>

            <p>This fall, i have once again fallen prey to knowledge, mainly thanks to two causes. </p>

            <h3>uni!!</h3>
            <p class="h-footer">uni is starting again!! (and this year, i get to pick the courses!) </p>

            <p>at the same time, i also somehow remembered that i had a professor who had told a friend of mine that he had done his erasmus there. so, i sent him an email to ask him if he could give me his impressions of the course, and he told me he could tell me about it in a meeting. (extremely nice of him!) so i went. and it was one of the most useful conversations of my (recent) life!!! (i love academia!!! knowledge is so amazing!!!!!) he completely sold me on the university. he told me about the courses he'd taken and the professors who held them, about vienna and about research in italy and about
