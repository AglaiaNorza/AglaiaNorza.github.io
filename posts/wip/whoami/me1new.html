            <p>“I, creature of echoing caverns that I am, [and] I suffocate because I am
word and also its echo”</p>

            <p>“What shall I tell you: I shall tell you the instants. I go too far
and only then do I exist and in a feverish way”</p>

            <p>“Is my theme the instant? the theme of my life. I try to keep up
with it, I divide thousands of times into as many times as the
number of instants running by, fragmented as I am and the
moments so fragile-my only vow is to life born with time
and growing along with it: only in time itself is there room
enough for me”</p>

            <p>“To interpret myself and formulate me I need new signs and
new articulations in shapes found on this side and beyond my
human story. I transfigure reality and then another dreaming
and sleepwalking reality, creates me. And all of me rolls and as
I roll on the ground I add to myself in leaves, I, anonymous
work of an anonymous reality only justifiable as long as my life lasts”</p>
