                <li>Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means—just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced. </li>
                <li>7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. </li>
                <li>what really is *reality*? we only live in our head (5.63 I am my world.), we have no way to know reality and truly "reality" is what we can picture in our heads - sicnce our heads only do that with our language, isn't everything that exists somehow filtered via our language? + we have no way of knowing something that "doesn't exist", as by thinking about it we are willing it into existence - where really is the limit? we have no way of truly knowing it because if we did, it would be pushed back (it wouldn't be the limit anymore, as we would have thought it)</li>
            </ul>

            language doesn't just describe reality but filters it, distorts it, replaces it --> where language fails we see our limits 
            <br>
            Early Wittgenstein + Sapir–Whorf = a structural constraint: what we can notice, remember, or even ask is shaped by available linguistic categories

            <br>
            the role of incommunicability --> (mirror: memory, trauma, and time refuse linear narration, godot: repetition exposes emptiness, language exhausts itself, lost in translation + in the mood for love: meaning from what is *not* communicated, the silence, the ineffable, sigur+cocteau, words are futile devices when talking about intimacy) meaning often emerges not despite the failure of representation, but through it.

            <br>
            LLM+ gorgia persuade rather than understand, symbolic ai/llms witt/gorgia - but does this use of LLMs actually show what language truly "is" for us ? a tool we do not understand
            <br>
If language alone can generate a convincing “world,” what distinguishes a real one?
        <br>
            what happens at the margins
            <br>

            translation !!!reveals not equivalence but the incompleteness of languages
