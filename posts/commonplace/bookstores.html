                very very small but full of great picks!! great selection of smaller publishing companies, cozy vibe (i also like that some books are 'hidden' on lower or higher shelves). they also have more books in english than you'd expect from a space that small.

                probably my favourite museum bookstore. (museum bookstores are hugely underrated as just-bookstores). very cool art books, great english picks, and fun trinkets. i quite like the interior design, too.

                queer/feminist classic. great to go get an aperitivo, very interesting events with authors. a staple. highly recommend visiting.

                i had a very nice chat with one of the booksellers, who shared my passion for clarice lispector and recommended ingeborg bachmann (real), celan and finally fleur jaeggy's 'sweet days of discipline' to me (which i did buy and enjoyed a fair amount).<br>
                the bookstore is stunning, and i quite like their selection ! i've never sat at the café, but i plan to

                both very nice bookstores !! i actually haven't had the chance to try altroquando's pub yet, which is an absolute shame (a bookstore that's also a pub ?? literally my dream)
                (otherwise is an international bookstore, while altroquando is italian - &they're on the same street)

                great queer bookstore ! a bit too modern-looking in my opinion, but queer and feminist bookstores are always appreciated. <small>(there's one in milan, too ! i've never been though)</small>

                very particular place - magazine bookshop (carries books too) with a lot of things you wouldn't find anywhere else. i love it, and yet i can never find anything that is 'me' enough to buy (i know nothing about contemporary art/graphics/cooking/obscure topic-magazines, sadly). i do really like their logo and have it everywhere though:

                okay, probably the most famous bookstore in berlin... not a niche pick at all. but it's crazy....... every time i've been, i've felt like i could just start living there. they have vinyls and weird trinkets and so many books and their bar has a record player and vinyls displayed on shelves?? also the english bookstore section is its own section and yet pretty big ?? aaaa, i wish we had a three-floor bookstore like it in rome.<br>
                <small>(also, fun fact, its armchairs saved me at least twice the second time i went to berlin, when i was staying at a family friend's house in grunewald and was spending the entire day walking around to get the most out of the vacation)</small>
